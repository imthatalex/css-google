# Google Home Page Design

## From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

The purpose of this project was to simply recreate the homepage of Google, there were no requests for functionality or scalability, purely design was asked, I took the liberty of making a responsive static imitation of the Google home page and as well added some javascript in order to include the mobile navbar when needed.
